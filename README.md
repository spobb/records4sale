# Records4sale

Records4sale is a fake music marketplace, developed as part of my first year at the EFP.

## Features

- Basic use of views and partials.
- Allows adding new items through the admin backoffice.
- Handles adding new items, creating folders in the file tree named after the id.

## Technologies

The website was developed using vanilla HTML, CSS, JS & PHP - the handling of views and partials was made without any frameworks, allowing me to learn more about the inner workings of back-end frameworks.
